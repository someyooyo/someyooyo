Configuration
=============

Powerline is configured with one main configuration file, and with separate 
configuration files for themes and colorschemes. All configuration files are 
written in JSON, with the excepton of segment definitions, which are written 
in Python.

Powerline provides default configurations in the following locations:

`Main configuration`_
    ``powerline/config.json``
`Color scheme`_
    ``powerline/colorschemes/default.json``
`Theme`_
    ``powerline/themes/{extension}/default.json``

The default configuration files are stored in the main package. User 
configuration files are stored in ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/powerline`` for Linux 
users, and in ``~/.config/powerline`` for OS X users. This usually 
corresponds to ``~/.config/powerline`` on both platforms.
